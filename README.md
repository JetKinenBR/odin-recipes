# odin-recipes
For the Odin Project

This is the project for the initial HTML section on Odin-Project.
Here I hope to build a really basic recipe site with a homepage and two or three recipe pages.
I'll build the boilerplate, use bold and italic, build lists and post links and images linking the recipes to the homepage and filling those pages with pictures of the food

Post Project=I have finally finished it all. Didn't really have to look back on anything though admittedly I have used a lot of emmet's shortcuts at least for the making of the lists. Though in retrospective I shouldn't have been using the first boilerplate and copying and pasting it for the other recipes at this point of life and should've instead just crammed them to build memory with some of those terms (meta charset="utf-8") being kinda problematic in my head.
That being said, I felt like it was smooth sailing for the most part and didn't really get stuck anywhere else.

Remembering to commit after every little thing is annoying as hell tho.
