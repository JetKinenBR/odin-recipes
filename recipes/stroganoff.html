        <h2>Description</h2>
        <strong>Beef Stroganoff</strong>, or <em>Estrogonofe de Carne</em>, as we call it in Portuguese, is a very popular dish in Brazil. Despite the fact that estrogonofe de carne is part of the everyday Brazilian life, this dish is actually Russian!
        <p>The biggest difference between the classic Russian and the Brazilian stroganoff is that the classic version uses mustard, vegetable or beef stock (occasionally uses tomato sauce, too) and is finished with sour cream. The Brazilian version uses tomato sauce (or paste) mixed with heavy cream and is almost always served with white rice or potato sticks (batata palha).</p>
